Reduced Pricing is based on **Term x Class Offering x Attributes x Payment Option**

### Term

The longer the term, the greater the savings

1-3 years

They don’t renew automatically, so have to purchase again

When term expires, they flip to on-demand with no interruption to service

### Class Offerings

The less flexible, the greater the savings

Standard - 75% reduced compared to on-demand; can modify RI attributes

Convertible - 54% reduced compared to on-demand; can exchange RI based on attributes if greater or equal in value

### Payment Option

The greater upfront, the greater the savings

All upfront - start of term

Partial Upfront - portion at start, rest billed at discounted hourly rate

No Upfront - discounted hourly rate, regardless if the RI is used or not
