# RI Limits

There is a limit to the number of RIs you can purchase per month

Per month:

- 20 Regional RIs per Region
- 20 Zonal RIs per AZ

### Regional Limits

**Cannot** exceed the running on-demand instances limit, which is 20

Before buying RIs, ensure the on-demand limit is greater or equal to the Regional RIs number you wanna buy (maybe request a limit increase if not)

### Zonal Limits

**Can** exceed the on-demand instances limit

If you hit the limit of 20, and you buy 20 Zonal RIs, you can launch another 20 on-demand instances the match the specs of Zonal Reserved Instances
