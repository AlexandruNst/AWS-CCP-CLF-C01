# Spot Instances

AWS has **unused capacity** that they want to maximise the utility of their idle servers

Like when planes offer discounts to fill vacant seats

90% discount compared to on-demand

Spot instances can be terminated if the computing capacity is needed for on-demand customers

For apps with flexible start and stop, and feasible at very low compute costs
