# On-Demand

A **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model**

Consume compute, then you pay

When launching an EC2, you **enable by default on-demand pricing**

On-demand has **no up-front payment and no long-term commitmen**t

You are charged per second (minimum of 60s) or per hour

Per second pricing for Linux, Windows, Windows with SQL Enterprise/Standard/Web Interfaces **that do not have a separate hourly charge**

Per hour pricing for everything else

When looking up pricing for EC2, the prices are always per hour, but in the billing, you get a breakdown by the second

Good for first trials/experiments of the app.

When you figured out the kind of demand the app will require, move to Reserved
