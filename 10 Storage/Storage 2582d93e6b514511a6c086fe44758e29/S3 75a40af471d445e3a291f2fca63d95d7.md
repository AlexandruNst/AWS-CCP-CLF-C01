# S3

What is Object Storage?

<aside>
⚠️ Storage architecture that manages data as objects

</aside>

…and not as 

- files with a file architecture
- blocks with sectors and tracks

S3 provides **unlimited storage**

You don’t need to think about underlying infra

S3 console has an interface to upload and access data

Can have up to 100 buckets in total

## S3 Object

Contains your data

Like files

Object consists of:

- **Key** - object name
- **Value** - data itself, sequence of bytes
- **Version ID** - when enabled
- **Metadata** - additional info about the object

**Object can have anywhere from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes**

## S3 Bucket

Buckets hold objects

Can have folders which in turn hold objects

S3 name is universal, all bucket names are **unique**
