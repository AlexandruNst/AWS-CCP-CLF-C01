# Pub/Sub - SNS

Publish-subscribe patterns commonly found in messaging systems

Publishers **don’t send events directly to receivers**

Instead send to an [event bus](Event%20Bus%20-%20EventBridge%20cbcf2fb1180c483e9241fecddb5938a7.md), categorised into groups

Subscribers subscribe to these groups

New message → subscriber gets it immediately

The publisher has no ide who is the subscriber

Subscribers **don’t pull** for messages, they are **pushed** to the subscribers

Use case: real-time chat system, web hook system

Similar to Kinesis, but it’s limited to just these (???) with Kinesis you can do a lot more with it
