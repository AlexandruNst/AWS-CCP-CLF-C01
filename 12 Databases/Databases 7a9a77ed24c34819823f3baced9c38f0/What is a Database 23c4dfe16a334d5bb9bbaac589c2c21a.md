# What is a Database?

<aside>
⚠️ A data-store that stores semi-structured or structured data

</aside>

They are **complex** because they **require formal design and modeling techniques**

Can be:

1. Relational
    
    Structured data strongly resembling tabular data
    
    Row or Columnar oriented
    
2. Non-relational
    
    Semi-structured, may or may not represent tabular data
    

They have a rich set of functionality:

- Specialised language to retrieve data (SQL)
- Specialised modeling strategies to optimise retrieval
- Control over transformation of data into reports and other useful structures

➡️ Usually (Postgres etc) they are **relational row-oriented data stores**
