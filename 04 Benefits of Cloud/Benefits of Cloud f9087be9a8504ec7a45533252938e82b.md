# Benefits of Cloud / Six Advantages of Cloud

### 1. Trade capital expense for variable expense

**Pay-on-Demand** only for what you consume, no upfront cost

### 2. Benefit from massive economies of scale

**Sharing the cost with other customers** to maximise savings, as MANY users are each utilizing a fraction of a server.

### 3. Stop guessing capacity

**Scale up/down** to meet the current need. No need to pay for underutilised servers.

### 4. Increase speed and agility

**Launch resources quickly**, a few clicks in a few minutes, no need to wait for the IT department to implement the solution on-prem

### 5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers

**Focus on the customer and the app** development & config, no need to care about racking, stacking, powering servers etc.

### 6. Go global in minutes

**Deploy your app around the world** in a few clicks, with low latency at a minimal cost

- **Reliable** - Data backups, recovery, replication, fault tolerance
- **Elastic** - Automatically scale during spikes or dips
- **Current** - Hardware and software is patched, upgraded, replaced, with 0 interruption to you
