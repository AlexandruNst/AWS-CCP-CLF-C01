# LDAP

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

<aside>
⚠️ Application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over IP networks. (???)

Common use for LDAP is to **provide a central place to store usernames and passwords**

Enables same sign on - use a single ID and password, but enter it every time they want to login

Meant for directory management and creating, but CAN authenticate

In very simple terms, the LDAP server has a password for you stored in a directory. When you enter credentials, it literally just checks if the password matches.
