# Zero Trust Model

Operates on the principle of “Trust no one, verify everything”

Identity becomes the primary security perimeter (i.e. first line of defence to protect the company’s cloud resources)

Old way - Network centric security. If you’re in the office on the local network, it’s ok

New way - Identity centric. Remote workstations, bring your own device models made that difficult. Identity is not the main security measure. MFA, provisional access.

Identity Centric doesn’t replace, but augment Network Centric
