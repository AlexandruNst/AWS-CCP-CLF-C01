# EC2 Overview

<aside>
⚠️ Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows you to launch VMs

</aside>

A VM is an emulation of a physical computer using software

Easy to create, copy, resize and migrate your server

**Multiple VMs can run on the same physical server to share the cost**

“Instance”

EC2 is highly configurable and you can choose the AMI that affects:

- The amount of CPU
- RAM
- Network Bandwidth
- OS - W10, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 2
- Attach multiple virtual hard-drives for storage (e.g. EBS (Elastic Block Storage))

→ EC2 is the backbone of AWS Services, just like how the AWS is the backbone of AWS Infra
