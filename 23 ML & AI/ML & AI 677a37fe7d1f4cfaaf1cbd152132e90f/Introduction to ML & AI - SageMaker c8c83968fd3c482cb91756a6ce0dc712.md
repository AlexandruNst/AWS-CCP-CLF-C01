# Services:

## AWS SageMaker

Manages service to build, train, deploy ML models at scale

Supports multiple frameworks

- Apache MXNet for AWS
- TensorFlow on AWS
- PyTorch on AWS

Has sub-services

### SageMaker Ground Truth

Data-labelling service. Humans label the data set to be used to train ML models

### Amazon Augmented AI

Human intervention. When SageMaker makes a prediction itâ€™s not confident about, queue it up for a human review

^ Useful for supervised learning
