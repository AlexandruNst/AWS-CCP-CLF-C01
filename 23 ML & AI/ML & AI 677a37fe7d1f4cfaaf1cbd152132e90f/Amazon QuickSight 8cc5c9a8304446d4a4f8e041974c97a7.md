BI Dashboard that allows you to ingest data from various AWS storage and db services to quickly visualise business data with minimal programming or data formula knowledge

Very drag-and-drop

The way QuickSight manages to do these really fast is by using SPICE (super-fast, parallel, in-memory calculation service)

Sometimes it canâ€™t the data directly, so you might need to use Glue to transform the data before ingesting into QuickSight
