AWS Account is not the same as User Account

**Key Points:**

- In AWS you can have more than one account managed through a single account using Organizations
- Organizations allow you to setup consolidated billing where 1 account pays the AWS bill for all
- The payer account is the root level account in an Organization
- You can create isolated AWS accounts for different teams under the
payer account - and place them inside Organizational Units (OU)
- The separation of accounts into OUs allows you to set customized
permission boundaries on the accounts using Service Control Policies
(SCPs)
