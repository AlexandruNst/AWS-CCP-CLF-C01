![Untitled](Types%20of%20Cloud%20Computing%20Responsibility%20dedd63998b314feba1d02e661c8faacb/Untitled.png)

1. On-Prem
    - responsible for everything
2. IaaS
    - adopting the cloud cuts responsibilities in half
    - CSP sets up servers, storage, networks, the hypervisor for VMs
3. PaaS
    - Here we have Beanstalk as an eg
    - You just choose what you want and it’s managed
    - “I want a Ruby on Rails server” but you’re not saying what OS you need, you don’t have to manage Ruby on Rails version, update when it needs to etc.
4. SaaS
    - Microsoft Word as an eg
    - CSP is responsible for everything
    - You write stuff there, and the data is managed by the CSP in the cloud
    - You tops say where you want to store your data

Generally, the Customer is responsible for Data, Config, and user access

The CSP is responsible for the underlying infrastructure (except stuff like Bare Metal)
