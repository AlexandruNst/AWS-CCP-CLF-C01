# Evolution of Computing

Computing Power = Throughput at which a computer can complete a task.

These days:

**General computing** - Xeon CPU Processor (data centers, not home computers)

**GPU Computing** - Google has Tensor computing, 50x faster than CPU, ML/AI

**Quantum Computing** - D-Wave, Rigetti, IonQ, 100 Million x faster

AWS offerings:

General computing - EC2

GPU Computing - AWS Inferentiare (Inf1) (direct competitor for GCPâ€™s (google) Tensor Processing Unit (TPU))

Quantum Computing - AWS Bracket (partnership with CalTech)
