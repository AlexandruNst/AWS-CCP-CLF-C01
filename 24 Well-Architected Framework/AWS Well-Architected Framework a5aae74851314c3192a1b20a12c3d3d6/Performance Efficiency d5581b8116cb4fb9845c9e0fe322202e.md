# Performance Efficiency

### 1. Democratise advanced technologies

Focus on product development rather than provisioning and management

Take advantage of the cloud services offered for your specific use-case

### 2. Go global in minutes

Deploy around the world in AWS Regions, with low latency and minimal cost

### 3. Serverless architectures

Removes the need to run and maintain servers

Removes that operational burden on managing servers

### 4. Experiment more often

Try out different types of instances, storage, configs, resources etc

### 5. Consider mechanical sympathy

Choose the service that best matches your workload
