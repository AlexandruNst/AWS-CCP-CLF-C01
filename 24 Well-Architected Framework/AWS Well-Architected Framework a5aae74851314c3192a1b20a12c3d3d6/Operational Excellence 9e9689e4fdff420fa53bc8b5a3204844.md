# Operational Excellence

Design Principles

### 1. Perform Operations as Code

Apply engineering principles to cloud infra

Limit human error and enable consistent events

➡️ IaC

### 2. Make frequent, small, reversible changes

Update components regularly

➡️ rollbacks, incremental changes, CI/CD

### 3. Refine operations procedures frequently

➡️Game days

### 4. Anticipate failure

Analyse past failures to improve, kill servers to analyse recovery

### 5. Learn from all operational failures

Share lessons from past failures with the entire org

Exam: just need to know what’s under excellence, just the headlines
