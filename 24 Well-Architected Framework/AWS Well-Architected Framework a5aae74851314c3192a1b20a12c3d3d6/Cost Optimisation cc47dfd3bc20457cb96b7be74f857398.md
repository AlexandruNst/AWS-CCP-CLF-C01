# Cost Optimisation

### 1. Implement Cloud Financial Management

Take advantage of AWS tooling to know exactly what youâ€™re spending

### 2. Adopt a consumption model

Pay only for what you require, increase and decrease based on requirements

### 3. Measure overall efficiency

Measure business output when increasing or decreasing costs

### 4. Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting

AWS manages physical servers, powering them etc

Focus on customers and not IT infra

### 5. Analyse and attribute expenditure

Cloud allows you to identify the usage of certain systems

Allows to calculate Return on Investment on resources and adjust accordingly
