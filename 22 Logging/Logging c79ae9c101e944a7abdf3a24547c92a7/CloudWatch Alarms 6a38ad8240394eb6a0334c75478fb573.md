# CloudWatch Alarms

**Monitors a Metric based on a defined threshold**

                                                                                 Metric                                         Threshold

When the condition is met, itâ€™s going to **breach an alarm**

Changes state:

- OK - Metric is within threshold
- ALARM - Metric is outside threshold
- INSUFFICIENT_DATA
    - Alarm just started
    - Metric not available
    - Not enough data is available

When state changes, we can define **what action it should trigger**

- Notification
- Auto Scaling Group
- EC2 action
