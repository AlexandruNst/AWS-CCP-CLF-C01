# CloudWatch Logs - Log Streams & Events

# Log Streams

Sequence of events from an app or instance being monitored

You have say an EC2 instance, and you want the events **streamed** to CloudWatch Logs

Can create manually, but generally done by the service **automatically**

Available for a variety of services

- Lambda
- RDS
- EC2 etc

They all already send their logs to CloudWatch Logs
