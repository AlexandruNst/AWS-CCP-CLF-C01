# Landscape of CSPs

## Tier 1 (Top tier)

Early to market, wide offering, strong service synergy, well recognised

- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Alibaba Cloud

## Tier 2 (Mid Tier)

Backed by tech companies, but slow to innovate and turned to specialisation

- IBM Cloud
- Oracle Cloud

## Tier 3 (Light Tier)

VPS turned to offer IaaS. Simple, cost-effective

Most started with just a virtual machine, maybe added a Load Balancer

- Vultr
- Digital Ocean
- Linode
