# AWS Tools for PowerShell

PowerShell is a **command-line shell** and a **scripting language**

Unlike most shells that return text, PowerShell returns .NET objects

AWS has **AWS Tools for PowerShell**, which lets you interact with the AWS API via PowerShell **Cmdlets**

Cmdlets are special PowerShell commands in the form of capitalized verb-and-noun e.g. New-S3Bucket

PowerShell is available on the computer (windows)

On computers that donâ€™t have PowerShell, you can use the **[CloudShell](AWS%20CloudShell%200071877356264c209d440f80e27ae538.md) (**only in regions that support it)
